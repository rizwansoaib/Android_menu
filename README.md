# Menu 

- Options menu and app bar
The options menu is the primary collection of menu items for an activity. It's where you should place actions that have a global impact on the app, such as "Search," "Compose email," and "Settings."


- Context menu and contextual action mode
A context menu is a floating menu that appears when the user performs a long-click on an element. It provides actions that affect the selected content or context frame.
The contextual action mode displays action items that affect the selected content in a bar at the top of the screen and allows the user to select multiple items.


- Popup menu
A popup menu displays a list of items in a vertical list that's anchored to the view that invoked the menu. It's good for providing an overflow of actions that relate to specific content or to provide options for a second part of a command. Actions in a popup menu should not directly affect the corresponding contentâ€”that's what contextual actions are for. Rather, the popup menu is for extended actions that relate to regions of content in your activity.
